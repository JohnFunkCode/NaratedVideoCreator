The FBI tracks Cyber Fraud cases and publishes a list of the most common and most costly ones.   Let’s talk a bit about the most common and most costly scams that effect people over 60.

Investment Scams:, are the most lucrative for criminals. They involve convincing you to put your money in a fraudulent investment. Many of the most common investment scams today involve BitCoin. Bitcoin itself isn't bad, but be extra suspicious of anyone encouraging you to do something with BitCoin.

Tech Support Scams:, are where someone convinces you that they can help you with a technical support issue, and in the process they take control of your computer, or they get you to divulge critical personal information such as account numbers and passwords.

Business Email Scams:, usually involve legitimate looking email that get you to visit a fraudulent website that steals your password or account information.

Romance Scams:, are also known as confidence scams. They are scams where someone builds a relationship with you and grooms you to gain your trust.  They then pivot to take your money.

Government Impersonation Scams:, are also on the rise.   They usually start with text messages saying you have parking tickets or unpaid tolls, or that something is wrong with your social security payments.

I’m sure you’ve all seen at least a few of these scams.  I get them all the time, and I’ll show you a few examples I've collected.
