My goal for this session is to help you understand what’s going on in the world of cyber crime, and give you some concrete tools to make it a lot harder for criminals to impact your life.

There are 3 things I recommend everyone do:,
1, Freeze your credit,
2, Take a simple step to Prevent SIM Swapping Attacks,
3, Use a password manager.,

After this talk you’ll have everything you need to do those three things.

You’ll also know what to do if you are hit by cyber criminals.
