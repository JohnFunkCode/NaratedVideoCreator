As I said I recommend that everyone freeze their credit.

A credit freeze prevents criminals from opening new credit cards, or bank accounts in your name.   Freezing your credit is easy, but it does come with some inconvenience because you need to unfreeze it if you want to open a new account.   For most of us that’s a worthwhile trade off because as you get older your finances settle down and opening new accounts is a rare event.

To freeze your credit you need to contact the three credit bureaus: Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion and ask them to place a credit freeze on your account.   Once you’ve done that no one can open credit accounts in your name!

When you do need to open a new account such as a credit card, you simply request an unfreeze which usually stays unfrozen for a few days.  While your credit is unfrozen you can open new accounts, after that the freeze protections go back into effect.

The hand-out has Instructions for setting up a credit freeze with Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion.

One caveat is that some of the credit bureaus offer a paid Credit Lock that they say provides additional protection.   That extra protection isn't necessary, so don’t be confused by the similar name.  A free credit freeze is all most people need, and it's a great starting place even if you decide to pay for extra protection at some later date.
