Lets take a moment and talk about links in emails or text messages.   This also applies to QR codes or something that wants you to tap your phone.

First, we all know we’re not supposed to click links in emails and text messages.  The reason is it’s very easy to provide links that look ok, but aren’t.  Here are some examples of fraudulent links.

Ok Great, we all know not to click on links.   But what do you do instead??

, Rather than clicking on a link, the best thing to do is use a known trusted way to get to the information the link is trying to send you to.   For example if the link says it’s to my bank, I open a new window and log-on to my bank the way I usually do.  Or I look for the information in my banking app.   If a link tries to direct me to Amazon to look at a special offer, I ignore the link, and go to Amazon in a new browser window, the way I usually would, and look for the product there.  Get yourself in the habit of ignoring links and finding alternate ways to get to the thing the link points to.   You’ll be surprised it’s really easy.

As a side note, you might notice that I don’t include any links in my slides or in the handout.   I do that on-purpose because if I give you a link, it’s training you to click it.  Which is the opposit of what you should do.   I recommend trying that yourself. If you break the habbit of sending links, everyone around you will be a little bit safer.  And you will be a lot less likely to click on links yourself.   Go ahead give it a try!
