Throughout the talk, I referred to the hand-out that I created to supplement this presentation. If you are listening to this on youtube you can find a link to the hand-out in the description of the video. It has all the instructions for the things I recommended.   Please protect yourself by taking a few minutes to setup a Credit Freeze, SIM Protection, and a password manager.  Also make sure you update your computers and phones to get the latest protections that Apple, Google, and Microsoft provide as part of their on-going race with hackers.

The hand out also includes a list of additional resources you can use to learn more about preventing and reporting cyber crimes.
