So what should you do if you're a victim of cybercrime?

First remember it's not your fault that a criminal has targeted you.  Don't hide it or cover it up! Report it! These are professional criminals who pray on unsuspecting victims.

Contact your local police or sheriff's office immediately by looking up their contact information from a trusted source. Your local police will likely take a report, and start an investigation.  They may also bring in federal resources if appropriate.

You can also contact the FBI Internet Crime and Complaint Center by calling 1 800 CALL FBI.  They are experts in dealing with cyber crimes, and they will help you if you don't know what else to do.

What every you do, don't try to handle the problem yourself.  You are probably being attacked by professional criminals.  Trying to handle it yourself is likely to drag you deeper into their clutches.   Don't do that, reach out to law enforcement via known trusted channels.
