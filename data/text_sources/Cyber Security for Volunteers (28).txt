We covered a lot of ground today.

We talked about protecting yourself from a variety of scams and how to prevent identity theft.  And we talked about ways to keep your devices safe from Malware and theft or loss.

Remember, there are three big action items I want everyone to take away from this session.
One:, Freeze your credit.
Two:, Turn on Sim Swapping Protection with your mobile carrier.
Three:, Setup a Password Manager.

If you do those three things to protect yourself, you will dramatically decrease the odds you’ll be wiped out by cyber criminals.
You’ll still have to watch for the common red flags for scams, work to never click on links, and take a moment to think before acting if you sense a scam.  But you’ll have the baseline mechanisms in place to protect yourself.

Thanks for sticking with me, I hope you found it helpful.
