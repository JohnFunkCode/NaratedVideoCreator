We covered a lot of ground today.

We talked about protecting yourself from a variety of scams and how to prevent identity theft.  We also talked about ways to keep your devices safe from Malware and theft or loss.

Remember, there are three big action items I want everyone to take away from this session.
One:, Freeze your credit.
Two:, Turn on "Sim swapping protection" with your mobile carrier.

You also have a few new tools you can use to protect yourself.
