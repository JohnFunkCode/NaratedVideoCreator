I’m John Funk with the Pet Therapy program.  This is a picture of my partner Karat.  She loves visiting patients and staff here at the hospital, so you might see us making the rounds.

When Heather mentioned she wanted to find someone to do a talk about Cyber Security Safety, I volunteered because I’m a Software Engineer who used to run the education department at a silicon valley tech company.   In that role, I developed a Cyber Security training program for engineers at the US Army Software Factory.   Now that I’m retired, I still stay current with Cyber Security topics, and I’m happy to share a bit of what I know to help you all stay safe from cyber criminals.
