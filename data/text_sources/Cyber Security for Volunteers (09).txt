Here are a few real-world examples I’ve encountered recently.

Number 1 is a flyer I saw posted by my local police department warning about scams affecting people in our area.  It calls out the following common scams:
They are warning people about calls from someone claiming a friend or family member has been arrested.,
They also see an increase in calls from someone claiming to be from your bank, saying your account has been compromised.,
And they are warning about calls from someone claiming to be a law enforcement officer, saying you’ll be arrested if you don’t pay a fine.,

Number 2, is a text I got claiming to be from the DMV saying I had an outstanding fine, and demanding that I “Pay Now” - Notice it came from country code +63. That's a phone number in the Philippines!

Number 3, is a text I received claiming I had an unpaid Express Toll, saying this is the last warning, and demanding that I “Pay Now” - Notice it came from a non-descript gmail account.

Number 4, is the newest one.  It claims to be from one of my children asking me to send them a message on their new phone.  This one is good!  I think it would trick most people.  For me it was an obvious scam because I don't have kids! I bet it's the beginning of a confidence scam where the criminals are trying to groom me into trusting them so they can take advantage of me later.

Number 5, is more subtle, and even I couldn’t see anything wrong with it.  It's an email from someone I don’t know claiming to send me 40 dollars, prompting me to click the “Accept the Money” button.   This one was tricky.  The only way I knew it was fake is I logged into paypal and saw there was no sign of any pending money transfer in my account, and of course I don't know the person in the email.

Notice the common theme in each of these examples is that they try to instill a sense of urgency to get you to act now.  Don’t do it!, Instead, just delete the message and move on.
