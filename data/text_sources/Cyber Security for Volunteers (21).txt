To reiterate, here are ways to block direct-theft scams.

Trust no one! If you get an unsolicited electronic message, don’t trust it, and don’t hesitate to delete it.,

, Stop and Think before acting.  Especially if they contacted you when you’re busy doing something else.,

, Don’t click links!  Even I can’t tell if a link is malicious.  So don’t trust them, go look up the information yourself rather than relying on a link someone provides for you. We'll talk more about this in a moment.,

, Most importantly, don’t trust things that are urgent!  I don’t know about you, but I question anything that's urgent.  Maybee that's just conditioning from years in business leadership, but it serves me well when evaluating scams.,

, Verify Everything, if someone reaches me via electronic communications, I double-check everything they say.  I never trust links or phone numbers they provide.  Instead, I look up the information myself.,

, And Never, Never-ever grant anyone remote access to your computer or phone!
