Before we close, I want to make sure to mention something about keeping kids safe online.   This is not my area of expertise, but I want everyone to have an overview of this widespread problem.

First, Scammers and Criminals don’t just target adults.  They also target kids.

Professional criminals target kids through social media, in-game chats, and via messaging apps.  The criminals often pose as kids using fake names and pictures to trick kids into trusting them.

They pray on kids natural weaknesses by using their superior coercion skills to outwit unsuspecting children.

Even if you’re not a parent, I think it’s worth gaining some awareness of this problem.   The best source to learn from is the FBI's website.  They have videos and conversation guides for parents and caregivers as well as resources for victims.  You can find their information quickly by searching the phrase “FBI Sextortion”.
