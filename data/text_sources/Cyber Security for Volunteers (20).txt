Direct-theft scams are nothing new.   Scammers have been running their schemes since the dawn of time.
However, as we discussed, technology gives scammers across the globe incredible reach that they've never had before and they’re finding new and creative ways to make the most of that reach.

To thwart their efforts, you need to be on the lookout for some common red flags.

I look at each of the items on this list as check boxes to help determine if something is a scam.  If it checks one or two boxes on the list, it’s probably a scam.

, First off, is this coming in on an unsolicited electronic channel like an email or a text message?   If so it’s more likely to be a scam than if I’m talking to someone face to face.

, Second, are they trying to get me to do something urgently?   Or in secret?   Are they pushing to do it now, and dont’ tell your wife or kids?  If so, Check, it’s probably a scam

, Next, is it from someone I don’t recognize?   Remember the $40 dollar paypal payment from someone I don't know?  ,Check, it’s probably a scam!

, Are they asking for gift cards or Bitcoin? No one I know would do that, it’s probably a scam.

, Are they asking me to verify some personal information? If they say “We need to validate your account number, phone number, and password, before we proceed”, That’s questionable and is probably a scam.

, is their offer simply too good to pass up?  Yep, it's Probably a scam!

, And lastly, do they want to assist you with something technical by running your computer remotely?   No way, don't do it!  Hang-up now!

, Remember if you can check more than one of the boxes on this list, it's likely a scam, And you should stop right away!
